How to Run TCP Measurement

This guide explains how to set up and run a TCP measurement using the nettest tool.

Prerequisites

- Download the nettest binary from GitHub Releases
- Choose the appropriate version for your operating system and architecture

Step 1: Download nettest

Visit https://github.com/specure/nettest/releases and download the latest release for your platform:

Linux/macOS
Download and extract:
wget https://github.com/specure/nettest/releases/download/latest/nettest-<distribution>-<arch>.tar.gz
tar -xzf nettest-<distribution>-<arch>.tar.gz

Windows
Download and extract:
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/specure/nettest/releases/download/latest/nettest-windows-x86_64.zip" -OutFile "nettest-windows-x86_64.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "nettest-windows-x86_64.zip" -DestinationPath "."

Step 2: Start the Server

Run nettest in server mode. The server will start on the default port 5005:

Linux/macOS
./nettest -s

Windows
.\nettest.exe -s

You should see output similar to:
Nettest Broadband Test Server
Listening on port 5005

Step 3: Run the Client

Open a new terminal/command prompt and run nettest in client mode, specifying the server's IP address:

Linux/macOS
./nettest -c <server_ip_address>

Windows
.\nettest.exe -c <server_ip_address>

Examples:
- For local testing: ./nettest -c 127.0.0.1 or ./nettest -c localhost
- For remote server: ./nettest -c 192.168.1.100

Step 4: View Results

The client will perform the measurement and display results including:
- Download speed
- Upload speed
- Ping

Troubleshooting

Port Already in Use
If port 5005 is already in use, you can specify a different port:
Server: ./nettest -s -p 5006
Client: ./nettest -c <server_ip> -p 5006

Firewall Issues
Make sure the server port (default 5005) is open in your firewall.

Connection Refused
- Verify the server is running
- Check the IP address is correct
- Ensure both client and server are on the same network or have proper routing


Protocol Information

The nettest tool implements the RMBT (RTR Multithreaded Broadband Test) protocol for accurate bandwidth measurements. For detailed protocol specifications, see the RMBT Protocol Extensions documentation.
